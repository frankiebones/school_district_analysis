# Overview:
We were tasked with locating trends in school performance to better allocate budgets. We compared results across grades 9-12 for math and reading scores, the number of students who passed each subject with a grade of 70 or higher as well as the combined total of those who passed both math & reading. We then used the provided data to further analyze those results based on a number of factors for each school. These factors included the school size, their overall spending, their average spending per student and the school type (whether District or Charter).

**Please note:** We were forced to remove all of the **9th grade** scores for **Thomas High School** due to evidence of academic dishonesty.

# Results:

In terms of the district summary there is little to no change between the altered grades and that which had the grades removed completely. 
We do however see a change when comparing the school summaries, most noticably in the average of students who passed math or reading.

This led to:
- a decrease of approximately 28.4% in percentage of those who passed overall
- lowering their ranking of Charter schools from 2nd to last
