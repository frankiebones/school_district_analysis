# Overview:
We were tasked with locating trends in school performance to better allocate budgets.  
We compared results across grades 9-12 for math and reading scores, the number of students who passed each subject with a grade of 70 or higher as well as the combined total of those who passed both math & reading.  
We then used the provided data to further analyze those results based on a number of factors for each school. These factors included the school size, their overall spending, their average spending per student and the school type (whether District or Charter).

***Please note:*** We were forced to remove all of the **9th grade** scores for **Thomas High School** due to evidence of academic dishonesty.

# Results:

In terms of the district summary there is little to no change between the altered grades and that which had the grades removed completely.  

We do however see a change when comparing the school summaries, most noticably in the average of students who passed math or reading.

This led to:
- a decrease of approximately 28.4% in percentage of those who passed overall
- lowering their ranking of Charter schools from 2nd to last

In my opinion this data pipeline needs improvement as the amount of suffixes/prefixes that were included is too large. My guess is someone used a template for a survey that included all the suffix/prefix options in a drop down menu and the students just couldn't help themselves. This could also have led to the tampering that caused the 9th grade scores at Thomas High School to be removed thereby leading to their lowered ranking among the other schools.
